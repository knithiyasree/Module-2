## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - RELATING THREE NUMBERS

---

### AIM  
To Write a function which takes three arguments: a and b and c and returns the addition of them: a+b+c. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Define a function that accepts three arguments: a, b, and c.
3. Inside the function, calculate the sum as a + b + c.
4. Return the sum.
5. Assign the function name as f.
6. Call the function with three input values.
7. Display the returned sum.
8. End the program.

### PROGRAM

```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
f=lambda a,b,c:a+b+c
print(f(a,b,c))
```
